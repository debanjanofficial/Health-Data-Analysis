# Health-Data-Analysis

### Objective
The objective of this Health Data Analysis project is to analyze various aspects of health data, including patient demographics, disease prevalence, and healthcare utilization. The goal is to identify trends and patterns that can inform healthcare strategies, improve patient outcomes, and optimize resource allocation.

### Discussion
The Health Analytics Dashboard provides insights into several key areas:

1. **Patient Count by Month**:
   - Displays monthly trends in patient count from 2014 to 2022.
   - Highlights any seasonal variations or long-term trends in healthcare demand.

2. **Gender Ratio**:
   - Visual representation of the gender distribution among patients.
   - Shows a nearly equal split between male (49.8%) and female (50.2%) patients.

3. **Ethnicity vs Patient Count**:
   - Compares patient counts across different ethnic groups.
   - Helps in understanding the ethnic composition of the patient population and identifying any disparities in healthcare access.

4. **Patient Count by Compulsion Type**:
   - Analyzes the distribution of patients by different types of compulsive behaviors.
   - Identifies the most common compulsive behaviors, which are washing (321), counting (316), and checking (292).

5. **Patient Count and Obsession Score vs Obsession Type**:
   - Evaluates both the patient count and obsession scores for various types of obsessions.
   - Highlights the relationship between different obsession types and their severity, with the highest patient counts observed for harm-related (333) and contamination (306) obsessions.

### Learning
From the Health Data Analysis, several key learnings have emerged:

1. **Monthly Patient Trends**:
   - The patient count exhibits fluctuations, which could be correlated with seasonal factors or public health events.
   - Understanding these trends can help in better resource planning and management.

2. **Gender and Ethnicity Insights**:
   - The nearly equal gender ratio suggests a balanced gender representation among patients.
   - Disparities in patient counts across ethnic groups highlight the need for targeted interventions to ensure equitable healthcare access.

3. **Compulsion and Obsession Patterns**:
   - Certain compulsive behaviors, such as washing and counting, are more prevalent among patients.
   - Obsession types like harm-related and contamination have higher patient counts and obsession scores, indicating areas that may require more focused clinical attention.

### Results
The analysis provides several important results:

1. **Patient Count by Month**:
   - Identified periods with spikes or drops in patient count, which can inform scheduling and staffing decisions.

2. **Gender Ratio**:
   - Confirmed a balanced gender distribution among patients, which is crucial for designing gender-sensitive healthcare programs.

3. **Ethnicity vs Patient Count**:
   - Highlighted the ethnic distribution of patients, with Caucasian (398) and African (324) being the largest groups.
   - These insights can guide culturally appropriate healthcare services and outreach programs.

4. **Patient Count by Compulsion Type**:
   - Revealed that washing (321) is the most common compulsion type, followed by counting (316) and checking (292).
   - These findings can help prioritize mental health resources and interventions.

5. **Patient Count and Obsession Score vs Obsession Type**:
   - Showed that harm-related and contamination obsessions have the highest patient counts and obsession scores.
   - Indicates the need for specialized treatment plans for these obsession types to improve patient outcomes.

Overall, the Health Analytics Dashboard provides valuable insights into patient demographics, disease prevalence, and healthcare utilization. These insights can inform healthcare strategies, enhance patient care, and optimize the allocation of healthcare resources.
